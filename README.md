Oops! 😅 If you were expecting something different, that means the website is still working to update content 😒. That or the site is down 😳. Either way, please try again later 🙏.

Otherwise, this is the readme.md for my personal website code repository. This was built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) a great open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. If you are familiar with Rmarkdown documents, Quarto is the spiritual successor to Quarto with a number of excellent features. My favorite is being able to run code inline using Python, R, or Julia. 

If you'd like to build your own, it's pretty simple. I just followed the [migration from Fastpages guide](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/blogging.html) since I started with Fastpages a few years ago. They also have a [guide](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) for people wanting a fresh start or new to web development. Please note, you will need to install Quarto on your device before starting. 

Once created it's easy to publish updates to the site. I set it up to use the [publish command](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html#publish-command) `quarto publish gh-pages` from my local computer. This pushes to my github into the *gh-pages* branch which github then publishes to the *patdmob.github.io* website.
