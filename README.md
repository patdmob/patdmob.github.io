# Patrick D. Mobley

This is the code for my personal website. This was built using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) a great open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on Pandoc. If you are familiar with Rmarkdown documents, Quarto is the spiritual successor to Quarto with a number of excellent features. My favorite is being able to run code inline using Python, R, or Julia. And of course, this website was also built using Quarto. 

If you'd like to build your own, it's pretty simple. I just followed the [migration from Fastpages guide](https://nbdev.fast.ai/tutorials/blogging.html).
