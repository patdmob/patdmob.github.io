I'm still just learning. I'm no expert. 

Here are a few awesome blogs I have used for some of my insprations
https://forbo7.github.io/
https://www.mm218.dev/
https://beamilz.com/
https://albert-rapp.de/ and he has an excellent post on creating a Quarto blog https://albert-rapp.de/posts/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide/13_quarto_blog_writing_guide.html  

Of course the Quarto website is made with Quarto. And it has excellent documentation to get you started. Where there was some confusion, I referenced other's sites to see how they managed the issue.  

Changed the bootstrap tempate

I added comments like this... I preferred the genis because it stores the comments in the discussions section of github, which I think is cleaner. 

Add github "Report an issue"

At the time of writing this, I haven't added a subscription feature. But there are some great resources to do so.
