I recently finished reading *Swipe to Unlock* by Neel Mehta, Aditya Agashe, and Parth Detroja, and I wanted to share my thoughts on this fascinating book. It's an excellent read for anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the technology industry, the role of smartphones in modern society, and the future of technology.

The book starts with a comprehensive historical overview of technology's evolution, from the earliest computers to the advent of smartphones and beyond. The authors delve into the various components that make up a smartphone, including the hardware, software, and sensors, and explain the role of each component and how they work together to create the amazing experience that we all enjoy. While much of the content here was a review for me as a technologist, the explanations were entertaining and easy to read.

*Swipe to Unlock* continues by discussing how technology and business strategies have evolved together---all while using case studies to impart the impact these changes have on our daily lives. For instance, the book provides insights into the various business models that have been successful in the technology industry, such as advertising and freemium models. Additionally, the authors also offer valuable advice on how to create a successful startup in this ever-changing field. I found their explanations of the motivations that drive innovation and entrepreneurship to be particularly illuminating.

To me, one of the more thought-provoking sections of the book is the discussion of the business interplay between Eastern and Western business strategies. The authors provide a nuanced look into the different approaches taken by companies in these regions and how they have learned from each other to create successful strategies that take into account cultural and historical factors. For instance, the Eastern approach tends to emphasize building long-term relationships with business partners, while Western businesses prioritize scalability, efficiency, and speed. The book offers insights into how businesses can adopt a more collaborative and globally-minded approach by learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses. Undoubtedly, the East and West will continue to learn from each other and alter the way we do business globally.

One of the book's strengths is its ability to present complex topics in an easy-to-understand format. The authors use real-world examples and analogies to explain difficult concepts, making it easier for readers to follow along. However, some readers may find the book lacking in in-depth analysis on certain topics, which may leave them wanting more.

Overall, I highly recommend *Swipe to Unlock* to anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the technology industry. As someone who works in the tech industry, I found the book to be incredibly insightful and informative. The real-world examples used to illustrate the concepts discussed in the book were particularly engaging. It's an excellent read for tech enthusiasts, business professionals, and anyone who wants to learn more about how technology impacts our daily lives. So go ahead, swipe right, and add this book to your reading list!
