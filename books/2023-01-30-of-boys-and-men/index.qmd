*Of Boys and Men* is a thought-provoking book written by Richard V. Reeves that provides a comprehensive analysis of the issues faced by boys and men in today's society. Reeves, a political economist and social commentator, explores the male identity crisis, the intersection of race and gender, the influence of biology and culture on gender roles, and the political stalemate around gender issues. 

The author makes it clear that talking about men's issues does not in any way diminish women's issues. *Emphasizing one does not mean de-emphasizing the other.* It is possible to "walk and talk at the same time"---we can promote both women's and men's issues simultaneously for the betterment of society. To this end, the author walks a gendered and political tightrope, paying homage to both sides while trying his best to stress the importance of the under-discussed men's issues and their negative impact on society.

Hopefully, by the end of this article, you'll leave with a deeper understanding of the challenges and proposed solutions facing boys and men in today's world as expressed by Reeves. Whether you're interested in gender studies, sociology, or simply looking for a thought-provoking read, *Of Boys and Men* is a must-read book that will leave you with a new perspective on the male experience in society.

## Male Malaise

The author starts by examining the "male malaise" in the first section of the book. This refers to the sense of unease and dissatisfaction that many men feel about their place in the world. Reeves argues that this malaise is the result of shifting social and economic conditions facing men today. He examines the decline of male education, jobs, and family support, all of which have contributed to the male malaise. 

I'll briefly touch on how men are falling behind in education. He states that in 2019 the gender education gap was worse for men than it was in 1972 for women. This gap received a lot of attention in 1972, laws were passed to fix this issue, yet today this gap goes largely ignored. Women now make up the majority of college graduates, masters, and doctoral degrees. Meanwhile, men are more likely to drop out of high school and less likely to pursue post-secondary education---limiting their opportunities and making financial prospects worse. 

By examining the root causes of the male malaise, including the impact of changing gender dynamics and education, Reeves lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of the issues explored in subsequent sections.

## Double Disadvantage

In the second section, he explores the intersection of race and gender, and the unique challenges faced by boys and men of color. Reeves argues that boys and men of color face a "double disadvantage" due to the combined effects of racism and sexism.

Reeves examines the ways in which racial and gender biases intersect and compound to limit the opportunities and life chances of boys and men of color. He explores issues such as the school-to-prison pipeline, the impact of racial profiling on black and Latino men, and the disproportionate rates of poverty and unemployment faced by men of color.

Reeves also highlights the importance of understanding the unique experiences and perspectives of boys and men of color in addressing broader issues related to gender and equity. By recognizing and addressing the ways in which race and gender intersect to create a double disadvantage for some individuals, Reeves argues that we can work towards a more equitable and inclusive society.

## Biology and Culture

Continuing, Reeves delves into the complex interplay between biology and culture in shaping gender roles and identities. He explores the ways in which gender differences are influenced by both innate biological factors and cultural norms and expectations.

Reeves discusses the latest research on the biological basis of gender differences, including the socially-recognized differences in cognitive abilities, personality traits, and risk-taking behaviors. Largely, there is more overlap between men and women than not. He also explores how cultural expectations and stereotypes around gender can limit boys and men, and contribute to the male malaise.

Reeves argues that a better understanding of the interplay between biology and culture is necessary to challenge traditional gender roles and create more opportunities and flexibility for boys and men. He suggests that we need to embrace a more nuanced and complex understanding of gender that recognizes the ways in which biology and culture interact to shape who we are. By doing so, we can create a society that allows for greater freedom and choice for individuals of all genders.

## Political Stalemate

Next, Reeves looks into the political stalemate around gender issues, and the challenges facing policymakers in addressing the issues faced by boys and men. He devotes one chapter each to the political *left* and *right*, and discusses the failings of each to address this important issue.

Gender politics has become highly polarized, with little common ground between the left and right on issues related to gender and masculinity. He explores how political polarization has hampered progress on issues such as education, family policy, and criminal justice reform. 

But to change anything, finding common ground on these issues is critical if we are to make progress towards greater equity and opportunity for boys and men. Policymakers need to work across party lines to develop policies that address the unique needs and challenges faced by boys and men, while also promoting greater gender equality and social justice.

## What to Do

After depressing the readers with the headwinds facing men today, the author offers some hope as he concludes the book. He presents some solutions with caveats to ease the challenges facing boys and men. He advocates for a comprehensive approach, one that addresses the multiple and interrelated issues that contribute to the male malaise.

Education is a critical area in which to focus efforts to address the challenges facing boys and men. Reeves proposes increasing funding for early childhood education, improving teacher training to better support boys' learning styles, and expanding vocational education programs to provide boys with greater opportunities to develop practical skills. "Redshirting", or holding the boys back a year before starting school, has proven effective in other countries and could go far in improving the outcomes for men. 

Reeves also encourages men's participation in Health, Education, Administration, and Leadership (HEAL) careers which are growing fast. By the author's calculation, for every STEM job there will be three HEAL jobs by 2030. While traditionally dominated by women, these careers offer meaningful and fulfilling work that can help address many of the challenges facing society and prevent labor shortages in these fields. By promoting greater gender diversity and inclusion in these fields, we can create a more equitable and balanced society that benefits everyone.

To make change happen, we need to support policies that promote gender equality and social justice, while recognizing the unique challenges and needs faced by boys and men today. Reeves argues that policies such as paid parental leave, affordable childcare, and increased investment in education can help to address some of the challenges faced by boys and men, while simultaneously promoting greater gender equity.

## Of Boys and Men

*Of Boys and Men* is a thought-provoking book that provides a nuanced and comprehensive analysis of the challenges facing boys and men in today's society. The author challenges many of the assumptions and stereotypes that underpin our understanding of gender and masculinity, and offers a compelling vision for a more inclusive and equitable society.

While the challenges facing boys and men are complex and multifaceted, *Of Boys and Men* provides a valuable roadmap for how we can begin to address them. By promoting educational reform, challenging traditional gender roles and stereotypes, and promoting greater inclusion in HEAL careers, we can create a better future for boys and men, one that is characterized by greater freedom, choice, and opportunity. 

To do this, we don't have to stop promoting women's success, but rather include consideration of men's success as well. This consideration will benefit our whole society as a rising tide lifts all boats. Because, men's problems are our society's problems, and if left unchecked will continue to degrade the health of our society. 

*Of Boys and Men* is a must-read book for anyone interested in gender studies, sociology, or simply looking for a thought-provoking read. Richard V. Reeves offers a unique and insightful perspective on the male experience in society, and provides practical recommendations for how we can work together to create a more inclusive and equitable world for everyone.
