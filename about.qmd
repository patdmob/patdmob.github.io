As a technologist, data scientist, and product manager, I'm passionate about staying on top of the latest developments in technology and using data to drive informed decision-making. But, I also believe in the importance of balance and finding time to pursue other interests.

In my free time, I enjoy creating things and learning new skills. Whether it's 3d printing, playing piano 🎹, weight-lifting 💪, woodworking 🏡, electronics 🤖 (ex: Raspberry Pi), or learning to curl 🥌, I'm always eager to expand my knowledge and challenge myself. 

I've recently returned to blogging after a hiatus, and I'm excited to share my thoughts and ideas with you once again. While my focus may shift from post to post, you can expect to see a wide range of topics, from data science and programming to product management. To this end, I've added a book review section to share my thoughts on the books I read.

Currently, I'm primarily working with Python, but I'm always open to exploring new tools and technologies. You may come across some older posts where I've used R, and who knows what else the future holds!

Thank you for taking the time to get to know me, and I hope you enjoy reading my posts.
